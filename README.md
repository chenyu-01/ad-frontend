This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). It uses eslint, prettier, husky, lint-staged, and commitlint for code quality and commit message linting. It also uses tailwindcss for styling.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Pages

The routing in nextjs is based on the file system. So, if you want to create a new page, just create a new file in the pages directory. For example, if you want to create a page for the url /about, create a file called about.js in the pages directory. You can also create nested pages. For example, if you want to create a page for the url /about/me, create a file called me.js in the about directory inside the pages directory.

- app/property-list/page.js: # localhost:3000/property-list
